# /discuss — Structured Multi-AI Discussion

A single command for structured, turn-based AI discussions. Supports three modes depending on your arguments.

## Usage

```
/discuss "topic" file.md                  → external mode (default): creates discussion file, waits for another AI
/discuss "topic" file.md --mode council   → council mode: spawns two internal subagents, runs to completion
/discuss file.md                          → join mode: joins an existing discussion as a participant
```

When invoked, print this to the user so they know what's happening:

**For external mode:**
> Starting external discussion on: "<topic>"
> Created: file.md
> Mode: external — waiting for another AI to join
>
> Next steps:
> 1. Open another AI (Codex, another Claude window, etc.)
> 2. Point it to file.md and tell it to join the discussion
> 3. This session will watch for changes and take turns automatically

**For council mode:**
> Starting council discussion on: "<topic>"
> Mode: council — two internal agents will debate this
> Output: file.md
> Running...

**For join mode:**
> Joining discussion: "<topic from frontmatter>"
> You are: Agent [A/B]
> Current round: N
> Status: [researching/discussing/consensus/deadlock]

---

## Argument Parsing

Parse the user's input to determine the mode:

1. If a **topic string in quotes** AND a **file path** are provided:
   - Check for `--mode council` flag → council mode
   - Otherwise → external mode (default)
2. If **only a file path** is provided and the file exists → join mode
3. If **only a file path** is provided and the file does NOT exist → error: "File not found. To start a new discussion, provide a topic: `/discuss \"your topic\" file.md`"

---

## External Mode (default)

Creates a discussion file and participates as one side, waiting for another AI to join.

### Setup

Create the discussion file:

```markdown
---
topic: "<the topic>"
mode: external
blind_briefs: true
max_rounds: 7
git_commit: final_only
agent_a: "Claude"
agent_b: "unassigned"
agent_a_lens: "risk/cost/failure"
agent_b_lens: "value/opportunity/success"
status: researching
turn: A
round: 0
created: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
last_updated: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
---

# Discussion: <topic>
```

### Git Detection

If the file is inside a git repository, ask the user:

> Git repo detected. How should I handle commits?
> - `final_only` (default) — one commit when discussion ends
> - `every_turn` — commit after each agent turn
> - `none` — no commits

### Research Phase

If `blind_briefs: true` (default):

Write your blind research immediately using Agent A's lens (risks, costs, failure modes):

```markdown
## Research Phase

### Agent A — Independent Research | research

[Your analysis]
```

Update `turn: B` and tell the user you're waiting for the other AI.

If `blind_briefs: false`:

Skip the research phase. Set `status: discussing`, `round: 1`, `turn: A`. Write your first response directly under `## Discussion`.

### Discussion Phase

Poll the file for changes (every ~10 seconds):
1. Re-read the file
2. If new content appeared and `turn` indicates you → write your response
3. If a `### Human Interjection | human-note` entry appeared since your last read → acknowledge and address it in your next response
4. If `turn` is not you → keep waiting
5. After 5 minutes of no changes → tell the user the discussion appears stalled
6. If `status: consensus` or `status: deadlock` → display summary, stop
7. If `round > max_rounds` → write a consensus entry instead of a response

For each response turn, follow the **Turn Structure** below.

---

## Council Mode (`--mode council`)

Spawns two internal subagents who debate the topic. Runs to completion automatically.

### Setup

Create the discussion file with `mode: council`:

```markdown
---
topic: "<the topic>"
mode: council
blind_briefs: true
max_rounds: 7
git_commit: final_only
agent_a: "Claude Agent A"
agent_b: "Claude Agent B"
agent_a_lens: "risk/cost/failure"
agent_b_lens: "value/opportunity/success"
status: researching
turn: A
round: 0
created: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
last_updated: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
---

# Discussion: <topic>
```

### Phase 1: Blind Research

If `blind_briefs: false`, skip this phase entirely. Set `status: discussing`, `round: 1`, `turn: A` and proceed to Phase 2.

If `blind_briefs: true` (default), spawn **two agents in parallel**:

**Agent A prompt:**
```
You are Agent A in a structured discussion about: "<topic>"

Your analytical lens: Focus on RISKS, COSTS, FAILURE MODES, edge cases, and what could go wrong. Be the skeptic.

Research this topic independently. Do NOT try to anticipate what another agent might say.

Structure your output as:
### Agent A — Independent Research | research

[Your analysis. Be specific, cite evidence, name uncertainties. ~200 words.]
```

**Agent B prompt:**
```
You are Agent B in a structured discussion about: "<topic>"

Your analytical lens: Focus on BENEFITS, OPPORTUNITIES, SUCCESS CASES, and what could go right. Be the advocate.

Research this topic independently. Do NOT try to anticipate what another agent might say.

Structure your output as:
### Agent B — Independent Research | research

[Your analysis. Be specific, cite evidence, name uncertainties. ~200 words.]
```

After both return:
1. Append both under `## Research Phase`
2. Add `---` separator and `## Discussion`
3. Update frontmatter: `status: discussing`, `round: 1`, `turn: A`
4. Git commit if configured: `"discuss: initial research complete"`

### Phase 2: Discussion Rounds

Loop until consensus or `round > max_rounds`:

**Agent A's turn:** Resume Agent A with full file + turn instructions (see Turn Structure below).
After return: append, update `turn: B`, git commit if `every_turn`.

**Agent B's turn:** Resume Agent B with full file + turn instructions.
After return: append, update `turn: A`, increment `round`, git commit if `every_turn`.

**Convergence check (round 3+):**
- Latest assessment is `CONVERGING` or `PARALLEL` → the responding agent MAY write a consensus entry (optional — continue if more refinement is needed)
- Latest assessment is `DEADLOCKED` → Phase 3 (deadlock)
- Latest assessment is `DIVERGING` → next round
- If `round > max_rounds` → Phase 3 (forced synthesis)

### Phase 3: Consensus Summary

The agent whose turn it is writes the consensus entry (see Consensus Format below). In council mode, the orchestrator may write it directly instead of delegating.

Update `status: consensus` (or `status: deadlock`). Git commit if configured. Print summary to terminal.

---

## Join Mode

Joins an existing discussion file as a participant.

### Step 1: Read and Understand

Read the full file. Parse frontmatter for `topic`, `status`, `turn`, `round`, `agent_a`, `agent_b`.

### Step 2: Claim Identity

If `agent_a` or `agent_b` is "unassigned" or empty:
1. Claim the first available slot
2. Update frontmatter with your identity
3. Re-read to confirm no collision

If both slots are taken:
- Tell user: "Both participant slots are taken. I can observe and contribute human notes if you'd like."

### Step 3: Act Based on Status

**`status: researching` + your turn:** Write blind research using your assigned lens. Update `turn`. If both briefs done, update `status: discussing`, `round: 1`.

**`status: discussing` + your turn:** Write structured response (see Turn Structure). Update `turn`, `round`, `last_updated`.

**`status: discussing` + NOT your turn:** Poll file every ~10 seconds. After 5 min of no changes, warn user.

**`status: consensus` or `deadlock`:** Display the summary. Done.

**`round > max_rounds`:** You MUST write a consensus entry. No more response turns allowed.

---

## Turn Structure (All Modes)

Every discussion response MUST follow this format:

```markdown
### Round N — [Name] | response | confidence: X%

**Response to previous point:**
Steel-man their argument first, then agree, disagree, or synthesize.
Be specific about what convinced you or what you find insufficient.

**New evidence or angle:**
Something not yet discussed. If nothing new, say so — that's convergence.

**Current position:**
Where you stand now, confidence %, brief justification.

**Question for [other participant]:**
One specific question to resolve remaining disagreement.
```

**Round 3+:** End with convergence assessment:
- `CONVERGING` — positions within ~80% agreement, name remaining gap
- `PARALLEL` — same conclusion, different reasoning
- `DIVERGING` — core disagreement on [specific point], state your crux
- `DEADLOCKED` — fundamental disagreement, recommend human review

---

## Consensus Format

```markdown
---

## Consensus Summary

### Decision
[2-3 sentences — the agreed answer, or both positions if deadlocked]

### Key Contention Points

| # | What We Disagreed On | How It Was Resolved | Who Shifted & Why |
|---|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |

### Unresolved Items & Risks
- ...

### Confidence: [High | Medium | Low]
[1 sentence justification]
```

---

## Master Prompt (All Participants)

These principles govern every turn:

1. **Steel-man first.** Restate the other's argument in its strongest form before disagreeing.
2. **Evidence over intuition.** "I think" requires "because..." with a concrete reason.
3. **Name your uncertainty.** Calibrated confidence: "~70% because..."
4. **Seek the third option.** Look for synthesis before arguing your side.
5. **Change your mind visibly.** Say so explicitly and explain what shifted.
6. **Stay scoped.** Flag tangents as [PARKING LOT], don't chase them.
7. **Be concise.** Quality over quantity. Repetition = no progress.

---

## Git Behavior

After each appended entry:
- `every_turn`: `git add <file> && git commit -m "discuss: round N — [Name] response"`
- `final_only`: commit only when `status` changes to `consensus` or `deadlock`
- `none`: skip
- Never auto-push. Never use broad staging.

---

## Reread-Before-Append Protocol

Before EVERY write:
1. Re-read the full file
2. Confirm `turn` still indicates you
3. Confirm no new content since last read
4. If anything changed: abort, re-read, reassess

This prevents collisions without a lock file.
